## Convert the language of gacha records

By default, the language of gacha items is the one selected in game, but this can be changed manually in settings menu in gacha records page. You can fill in all the language categories supported by the game. If you don't click **Apply**, new gacha records will use this language setting; if you click **Apply**, all current gacha records will be converted to the set language.
