# Starward

> **Starward** comes from the slogan of Star Rail: May This Journey Lead Us **Starward**, which is very suitable to be used as an app name.

Starward is an open-source third-party launcher developed to address the shortcomings of HoYoPlay (miHoYo Launcher). It supports all PC games on of HoYoverse and aims to completely replace the official launcher. In addition to the basic functions of a launcher, I will also incorporate some additional features based on individual needs, such as:

-  Record game time
-  Switch game accounts
-  View game screenshots
-  Save gacha records

More features are left for you to explore...

First of all, I would like to express my sincerest thanks to all the contributors and translators of this project. Starward can only become better because of you.

Then, I want to express my special thanks to [@neon-nyan](https://github.com/neon-nyan). The inspiration and design for this project come directly from his project [Collapse](https://github.com/neon-nyan/Collapse). I have gained a lot of knowledge from the Collapse code, and with such a valuable reference, my development process has been much smoother.

Next, a big thanks to the main developer of [Snap Hutao](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao), [@Lightczx](https://github.com/Lightczx). His assistance has been invaluable during the development of Starward.

Additionally, thanks CloudFlare for providing free CDN services, contributing to a great update experience for everyone.
