The PC game launcher of [HoYoverse](https://www.hoyoverse.com) is one of the worst commercial software I have ever seen. The overall user experience is passable, but it performs terribly in certain details:

- Lacks support for high scaling ratios, resulting in a hazy aesthetic across the entire interface.
- Resource verification utilizes a single thread, unable to effectively utilize multiple cores, leading to a significant waste of time.
- Despite having a built-in browser engine, the interface design has remained unchanged for years, failing to capitalize on the flexibility of web pages and, instead, adding unnecessary bulk.

# Starward

> **Starward** comes from the slogan of Star Rail: May This Journey Lead Us **Starward**, which is very suitable to be used as an app name.

Starward is an open-source third-party launcher developed to address the aforementioned shortcomings. It supports all PC games on of HoYoverse and aims to completely replace the official launcher. In addition to the basic functions of a launcher, I will also incorporate some additional features based on individual needs, such as:

- Record game time
- Switch game accounts
- View game screenshots
- Save gacha records

More features are left for you to explore...

## Install

First, your device needs to meet the following requirements:

- Windows 10 1809 (17763) and above.
- [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2) installed.
- For better experience, please enable **Transparency effects** and **Animation effects** in the system settings.

Next, download the package for your CPU architecture from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Scighost/Starward/releases). Extract it, then run `Starward.exe` and follow the prompts.
